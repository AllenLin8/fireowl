# FireOwl

Welcome to FireOwl!

FireOwl is an online service that allows users to submit locations of fires that they have seen. In addition, they can also view fires submitted by other users around the world, as well as government-reported fires that we gather data from. Finally, we also pull wind data from online weather APIs for each of the fires submitted, which can be viewed on the prediction mode of the website to see areas where active wildfires could be growing due to wind speed increases. These are highlighted on a scale from yellow to red on the regular map in terms of fire size and on a scale of blue on the prediction map for predicted growth size of fires.
